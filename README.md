## Problem 3: Bayes' Theorem for Medical Testing

**Problem Statement:**
- A disease affects 1% of the population. A test for the disease is 99% accurate (true positive rate). The false positive rate is 5%. Calculate the probability that a person who tests positive actually has the disease.

## Problem 4: Probability Distribution - Normal Distribution

**Problem Statement:**
- Generate a normal distribution dataset and calculate the probability of a value being within 1 standard deviation from the mean.
